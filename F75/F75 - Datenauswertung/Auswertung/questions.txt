Read the paper «A damage-tolerant glass» by Demetriou et al., Nature Materials, Vol. 10, p. 123 (2011).
Explain the main findings of this work. Make sure that you include an answer to the following questions in your text

- What is a metallic glass?
- What is the main difference in mechanical properties between oxide and metallic glasses?
- Explain the characteristics of the X-ray diffraction pattern in Fig. 1. Why is there only a single peak?
- Why are the metallic glasses particularly damage tolerant?
- What do you think could be a limiting factor in introducing this kind of material to the commercial 
market?

The goal of this experiment is to test methods of nuclear magnetic resonance with two different NMR analyzers. In detail we want to determine the spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation time for two samples with different concentrations of Gadolinium solved in water with the usage of the Bruker minispec p20 apparatus. Measurement of the former quantity is carried out via the spin echo as well as the Carr-Purcell method. With the same setup we furthermore measured the chemical shift of protons and used it to identify five different substances. The Bruker minispec mq7.5 is used for imaging measurements in one and two dimensions. One-dimensional processes such as the time dependent mixture of oil and sand are analyzed and two-dimensional imaging is used to map the inner volume of samples which contain oil or water.
